# Theatre-Ticket-Reservation-System
This project implements a theatre ticket reservation system using POSIX threads (pthreads). The system allows multiple clients to reserve seats, make payments with credit cards, and manage transactions concurrently. The program ensures mutual exclusion with mutexes and synchronization with condition variables.
